# Compass UOL Internship 2023

Projects developed during each sprint of the Compass UOL Internship program in machine learning for AWS.

For more details on the projects, each subfolder contains its own README file.

`GITLOG.txt` contains the output of `git log > GITLOG.txt` for historical purposes.

In each sprint folder, you will find the project's requirements, and in the subsequent folder, you will find my group's solution.
